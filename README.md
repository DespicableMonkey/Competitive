**My Competitive Programming Journey**
A collection of my solutions, scripts, and settings

Started in April 2021

Nearly 4 million lines of code.

This code does not contain comments, as it was produced in a competitive programming environment where you have just a few hours to solve
many different problems. 

The code utilizes various advanced data structures and algorithims including Graphs, Segment-Trees, Fenwick/BIT Trees, RMQ & Sparse Tables, Convex Hulls, DSU, Topological Sort, Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall, Seives & Miller Rabin, and Dynamic Programming
