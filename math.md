## Math Tips & Tricks

## General Math
- **Proizvolov's identity**
> Split a permutation of 2N into arbitrary subsets of size N labeled *A*, and *B*. <br> If you sort *A* in increasing order, and *B* in increasing order then <br>

## Graphs
- **Euler's Formula for Planar Graphs**:	
> V - E + F = 1 + C <br>
where *V*, is the number of vertices, *E* is the number of edges,  *F* is the name of faces, and *C* is the <br>number of connected components


## Bitwise

### Implementation Tricks
- **Highest Power of 2 some number, *x* is divisible by can be calculated by**
> (x & -x)
